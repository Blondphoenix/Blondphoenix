The dataset provides valuable insights into the reasons behind employee resignations, allowing us to explore patterns related to the duration of employment and age of the employees. Through this analysis, we aim to address specific questions posed by stakeholders: Are employees with shorter tenures resigning due to dissatisfaction, and how does this compare to longer-tenured employees? Additionally, we will investigate if there's a correlation between age and resignation due to dissatisfaction. To achieve these objectives, we will begin by cleaning and preparing the data, combining information from both surveys, and then proceed to analyze the data to draw meaningful conclusions. This project not only hones our data cleaning and analysis skills but also provides practical experience in handling real-world datasets to derive actionable insights.*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"cfc30bc4","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-18T04:17:15.284687Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-18T04:17:15.283925Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-18T04:17:16.380872Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-18T04:17:16.379556Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.110863,"end_time":"2024-05-18T04:17:16.383742","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-05-18T04:17:15.272879","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import

This creates separate copies of the filtered data, ensuring that any modifications made to these copies won't affect the original dataframes. This step helps to avoid the `SettingWithCopy` warning.\n","\n","These steps were necessary to isolate and extract the resignation data from both datasets for further analysis.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"360124c0","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015767,"end_time":"2024-05-18T04:17:17.76033","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-05-18T04:17:17.744563","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":664575,"sourceId":1171523,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30698,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":6.351894,"end_time":"2024-05-18T04:17:18.300101","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-05-18T04:17:11.948207","version":"2.5.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
